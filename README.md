Customer Fraud Detection Analysis using Machine learning models



The main objective of the customer Fraud detection analysis is to predict that if fraudulent credit card transactions can take place.




The steps involved in the project are:



1. exploring the dataset also visualizing the data set.



2. Data preprocessing



3. building machine learning models



4. evaluating the models



5.tuning the parameters for better accuracy



6.final model creation and analysis outcome.



for better accuracy results Ramdom Forest algorithm is used



Random Forest is easy to implement. It builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.







Final result of analysis:

The accuracy obtained is 90 (Random Forest algorithm)
